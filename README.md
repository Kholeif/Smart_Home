# Smart_Home
this is a project for a smart home which we can control things with tiva c microcontroller.

Smart Home System (SHS) is a dwelling incorporating a communications network that connects the electrical appliances and services
allowing them to be remotely controlled, monitored or accessed. SHS includes different approaches to achieve multiple objectives range from enhancing
comfort in daily life to enabling a more independent life for elderly and handicapped people. In this paper, the main four fields for SHS which are, home
automation and remote monitoring, environmental monitoring, including humidity, temperature, fault tracking and management and finally the health
monitoring have been considered. The system design is based on the Microcontroller MIKRO C software; multiple passive and active sensors and also
a wireless internet services which is used in different monitoring and control processes .This paper presents the hardware implementation of a multiplatform control system for house automation and combines both hardware and software technologies. The system results shows that it can be classified as
a comfortable, secure, private, economic and safe system in addition to its great flexibility and reliability.
